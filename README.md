# README


Logisim is a circuit simulator, [originally available here](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).


## Why this fork of Logisim?

Carl Burch, the original author of Logisim, abandoned development in 2011 and moved on to a similar successor project, [Toves](http://www.toves.org/) in 2013, because Logisim's code base is in need of a major overhaul. This fork of Logisim picks up the Portuguese translation where Dr. Burch left off and
updates it as needed.
